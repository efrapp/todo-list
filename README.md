# Todo List Application
Application to manage daily based tasks in a simple and orgnize way. It is inspired by the [Todoist app](https://todoist.com/). 

The true value of this app resides on the concepts apply to it. Been able to use the power of Prototypal Inheritance allows you to design software in terms of objects instead of classes and this open the possibilities to use very powerful concepts like composition and factories.
